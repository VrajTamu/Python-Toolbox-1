# Python-Toolbox-1
Here there are practice codes from Datacamp for the problems that are frequently occurring in Data Science field .


Instructions -
Unpack nums to the variables num1, num2, and num3.
Construct a new tuple, even_nums composed of the same elements in nums, but with the 1st element replaced with the value, 2.

Solution - 
# Unpack nums into num1, num2, and num3
num1=nums[0]
num2=nums[1]
num3=nums[2]
# Construct even_nums
even_nums = (2, num2, num3)
print(even_nums)
