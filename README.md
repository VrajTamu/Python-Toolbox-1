# Python-Toolbox-1
Here there are practice codes from Datacamp for the problems that are frequently occurring in Data Science field .


Instructions - 
Define the function count_entries(), which has two parameters. The first parameter is df for the DataFrame and the second is col_name for the column name.
Complete the bodies of the if-else statements in the for loop: if the key is in the dictionary langs_count, add 1 to its current value, else add the key to langs_count and set its value to 1. Use the loop variable entry in your code.
Return the langs_count dictionary from inside the count_entries() function.
Call the count_entries() function by passing to it tweets_df and the name of the column, 'lang'. Assign the result of the call to the variable result.


Solution -
# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(df, col_name):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of 
    occurrences as value for each key."""

    # Initialize an empty dictionary: langs_count
    langs_count = {}
    
    # Extract column from DataFrame: col
    col = df[col_name]
    
    # Iterate over lang column in DataFrame
    for entry in col:

        # If the language is in langs_count, add 1
        if entry in langs_count.keys():
            langs_count[entry]+=1
        # Else add the language to langs_count, set the value to 1
        else:
            langs_count[entry]=1

    # Return the langs_count dictionary
    return(langs_count)

# Call count_entries(): result
result= count_entries(tweets_df,'lang')

# Print the result
print(result)
